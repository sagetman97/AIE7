### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE7 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE7/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: This checks whether the chatbot can explain complex programming concepts in a simplified and beginner-friendly way. The goal is to assess how well it adapts its tone, structure, and analogies to suit someone with no prior coding knowledge. The explanation uses terms like “methods” and “attributes” without defining them clearly, which could confuse a beginner. It might help to improve prompt instructions to encourage simpler language and analogies. Adding markdown formatting (e.g., bold key terms) could also make the explanation easier to follow.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: This prompt tests the chatbot’s ability to distill a long, nuanced passage into a short, coherent summary that captures the most critical information. It evaluates comprehension, prioritization of ideas, and clarity of expression. The summary misses a few important points and reuses some original phrasing rather than rewording. I might improve prompt instructions to emphasize the need for abstraction and clearer, rephrased output. It could also benefit from formatting support to break ideas into separate lines or bullets.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: This prompt tests the model’s ability to generate creative and coherent narrative text. It evaluates storytelling skills, emotional tone, imagination, and the ability to stay within length constraints while maintaining engagement. The story feels a bit rushed and lacks a clear structure. It might help to add prompt instructions that guide the model, while staying within word limits. Supporting line breaks and formatting would make it more readable as well.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: This prompt tests the model’s ability to apply basic arithmetic and logical reasoning to solve a constrained word problem. It evaluates accuracy, step-by-step problem solving, and understanding of unit relationships. The model gives the correct answer but skips over the reasoning. It could be useful to prompt it to show its thought process step-by-step. Also, formatting the logic in a clearer way (e.g., numbered steps or line breaks) might improve readability.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: This prompt tests the model’s ability to adjust tone and style—specifically, transforming informal or casual language into a professional and formal register. It evaluates linguistic flexibility, audience awareness, and tone control. The tone is improved but still slightly casual in places. I might adjust the prompt to make the tone expectations more explicit and support clearer formatting to distinguish the rewritten version. 

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### Submitting Your Homework
#### Activity #1 and Discussion Question #1 Only
Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:
1. Create a branch of your `AIE7` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s01-assignment`
2. Create a markdown document (for example “ACTIVITIES.md”).
3. Copy the questions into the document.
4. For each question:
    + Answer the “Aspect Tested” question
    + Write up your evaluation of your system’s performance 
5. Answer “Discussion Question #1” at the end of this document.
6. Add, commit and push your new document to your origin repository.
>(NOTE: You should not, merge the new document into origin’s main branch. This will spare you from update challenges for each session.)

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub link to the new document on the tracking branch you created.

#### Activities, Discussion Questions _AND_ The Advanced Build:
For Activity #1 and Discussion Question #1, follow the same steps as above _**using your Challenge project's repo.**_

When submitting your homework provide the following on the form:
+ The GitHub URL to the markdown document you created in your Challenge project's repo.
+ The public Vercel URL to your updated Challenge project.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
